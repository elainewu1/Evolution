# Evolution

Purpose:
  To understand how the human gene become the way it is today where everyone has unique but very similar genome when it initially started with the exact same sequence. 
  
Usage:
  Simulate the DNA genomoe using name conversion. The process of how letter 'A' evolve into the the desired name provides an insight on how evolution takes place. 
  
  Currently evolution consists of cross over and mutation. 
    Cross Over is when the two genes mix and match. 
    Mutation consists of:
      Adding a gene
      Removing a gene
      Modifying an existing gene
   
   Each time after the change, we take the best fit onces into the next poll.
